A described in 2012, the best Google Correlate result per US State to the McCain vote in 2008 was the 2-gram "Obama jokes".
It is unclear how often the Google Correlate data is updated, and I didn't try to see if it was still the case when using the tool in 2016. 

But in 2016, the best correlate to the proportional Trump vote was also "Obama jokes". I don't know how old the data underlying Google Correlate underlying is.

I didn't test the 2012 vote share.
