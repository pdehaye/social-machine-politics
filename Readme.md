A described in 2012 in the [NYTimes](http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/googles-crystal-ball/), the best Google Correlate result per US State to the McCain vote in 2008 was the 2-gram "Obama jokes".
It is unclear how often the Google Correlate data is updated, and I didn't try to see if it was still the case when using the tool in 2016. 

But in 2016, the best correlate to the proportional Trump vote was also "Obama jokes", despite the Republican candidate winning the election this time. Try it out for yourself [here](https://www.google.com/trends/correlate#) using the `vote-wikipedia-Trump-2016.csv` file. I don't know how old the data powering Google Correlate actually is.

I didn't test the 2012 vote share.  

There is most likely nothing to this, as it could be the dataset hasn't changed in the meantime, and Google has actually used a fairly limited number of 2-grams.
